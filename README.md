Hi! I recently got a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W because of how good the reviews looked online, and because of the very powerful CPU it had in such a small form factor. This repository shall contain some of the projects that I am running on this specific board. As of 27/12/23(Sorry Americans), I've just completed cross compiling qt for the board, so I'll be adding the documents, and its projects it a folder of its own. Other than that, there are a few more things that I want to try out, such as:
- Home Assistant (IoT network running locally)
- PiHole (Ad-blocking the entire network by using a different DNS)
- Storage (Not sure how well it will work considering it doesn't have USB3.X and a 5GHz WLAN support, but it'll be a PoC).
- Internet Radio (Why not)
- Some Project involving communicating with a microcontroller.

I'll strike each of them one by one as they get completed.
